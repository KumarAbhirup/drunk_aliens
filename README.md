## 📖 Notes

Avoid resizing the game window while playing, weird stuff happens. On desktop, play only on large sizes. **If you resize your browser window to very short, game won't work.**

Few Koji Visual Customization Controls are already there for you to use. They were put together by @Svarog and @kumar_abhirup on Koji platform.

**Special thanks to @Svarog on Koji platform for his phenomenal help in the making of this game.**
